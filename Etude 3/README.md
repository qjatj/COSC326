# How to run the program

To compile and run the java programming for validating and outputing dates, follow the steps below.

1. Open terminal and locate to the folder containing the Date.java file. This can be done by using the cd function
   e.g. cd home/COSC326 (you can use the ls function to see if you have located to the correct folder)

2. Once you are inside the folder containing the Date.java file, compile it using the command javac Date.java

3. Once the program is compiled, run the program using the command java Date

4. If everything worked correctly, you should be prompt with a line asking you to input a date

5. Input dates and when done using the program, exit using the command ctrl + c or by exiting via the x symbol
   on the top right hand of the terminal
