Effective Programming paper

This paper aims to improve and develop your programming skills by setting a series of exercises, called études, which require an analytical and creative approach to problem solving. Most, but not all, of them will involve programming tasks. Some will not use computers at all, while others will use computers only for ancillary tasks. Each solution will be assessed against the requirements and you will be expected to go back and rework each étude until it is completed satisfactorily. You will be required to fully test and debug your programs as well as learn to identify inefficiencies.
